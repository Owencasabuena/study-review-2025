## Data types and Operators
### Types of data types
- Primitive data type
  Primitive data types are the most basic types of data in Java. They store simple, single values like numbers, characters, or true/false      values. These are not objects and don't have built-in methods.\
  Examples of primitive data types in Java: \
  * int – for whole numbers (e.g., 5, 100)
  * double – for decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)
  * char – for single characters (e.g., 'A')
  * boolean – for true or false values
  * byte, short, long, float – other number types with different sizes
- Non-primitive data type
