### Data types
#### Types of data types
- Primitive data type
  Primitive data types are the most basic types of data in Java. They store simple, single values like numbers, characters, or true/false      values. These are not objects and don't have built-in methods.
  
  Examples of primitive data types in Java:
  * int – for whole numbers (e.g., 5, 100)
  * double – for decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)
  * char – for single characters (e.g., 'A')
  * boolean – for true or false values
  * byte, short, long, float – other number types with different sizes
 
- Non-primitive data type
  Non-primitive data types are objects created from classes. They can store multiple values or more complex data, and they have methods      you can use to perform operations.
  
  Examples of non-primitive data types in Java:
  * String – for text (e.g., "Hello")
  * Array – for collections of data (e.g., list of numbers)
  * Class – a custom data structure with attributes and methods
  * Interface – a blueprint for classes to follow

### Operators
### What is OOP?
Object-oriented programming is a method used for designing a program using classes and objects.

### What is object?
Object is an instances of a class. These objects contains states(attributes) and behavior(methods/functions).
